### A secure and simple Jenkins template

We provide the Terraform template to provision a secure and easy to use Jenkins platform.

You can find the documentation in the [repository itself](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems). In particular, consult the main `README` file and the `docs` folder.

### Jenkins for the TechOps teams

There is an instance of the platform running for teams in TechOps. That can be found [here](https://prod.gds-re.build.gds-reliability.engineering). The repository with its configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-terraform).
