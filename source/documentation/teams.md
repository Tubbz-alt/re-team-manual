## Teams in Reliability Engineering

### Build systems

Our main focus is to provide Terraform code and easy-to-follow documentation for the provisioning of a secure, scalable, easily maintainable Jenkins platform to build and test code projects. We are also running discoveries on secrets management and identity management (in the 'build' space only).
