## Development process

There is currently no single development process within RE.  The processes to use largely comes down to the programme where the repository originated, and for new repositories, the programme from which the initial contributors to the new repository moved from.

### The GOV.UK development process

This is documented in the [GOV.UK Styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/pull-requests.md)
